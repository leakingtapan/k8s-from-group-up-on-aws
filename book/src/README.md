# Kubernetes from the Ground Up
This tutorial helps you through setting up kubernetes cluster from the ground up on AWS. This is inspired by [this]() blog. However, it is pretty old and incomplete.
The goal of this tutorial is to provide a smooth learning curve to help people to understand kubernetes in a practical but not that hard way. Since kubernetes is already complicated, I am not going to make it even harder for new beginners. And learning should always be an enjoying process.
